      "summary": "Never has a mountain occupied the German imagination longer and more thoroughly than Nanga Parbat (8,125m), the world's ninth-highest peak, located in the extreme western part of the Himalaya chain in present-day Pakistan. Repeatedly referred to in the 1930s as the German \"mountain of destiny,\" over a period of roughly two decades from 1932 to 1953 Nanga Parbat became not only the destination of six German mountaineering expeditions, but also the quintessential German \"mountain of the mind\" onto whose slopes German mountaineers, mountaineering officials, politicians, writers, and filmmakers projected some of the most pressing social, political, and cultural concerns of their times. This book is a detailed study of that process: of the initial motivations of post-First World War mountaineers for attempting to scale one of the tallest mountains in the world, of the appropriation of this epic mountaineering challenge by National Socialism, of the reappropriation of the Nanga Parbat project during the early years of the German Federal Republic. And most important - since to date such an approach is almost completely absent from existing studies of Himalaya mountaineering of this era - it is a study of the means and mechanisms, the texts and contexts employed for communicating these high-altitude mountaineering exploits to the German public and thereby inscribing Nanga Parbat into the German imagination.",
      "editors": [],
      "praise": [ "            Though the title suggests the book&#039;s common thread will be Nanga Parbat, in fact H\u00f6busch has given us something far more wide-ranging. &quot;Mountain of Destiny&quot; is a deeply sourced account of the co-development of mountaineering culture and Germany&#039;s modern self-identity, hinged around the rhetoric and trauma of National Socialism. . . . Students looking for introductory analyses of key primary sources in the history of mountaineering will find large parts of each chapter richly helpful. JOURNAL OF AUSTRIAN STUDIES\r\rReaders with interest in German mountaineering or film history will find value in the impressing amount of details the author presents.

Her book argues that \u201cenchantment\" became a vital mode of enacting the people after the demise of traditional monarchical forms and investigates this phenomenon throughout a wide range of social and political rituals and literary and cultural discourses.

      "keywords": [ "enchantment, the people, rituals, revolution, sovereignty, supernatural, time" ],
      "summary": "The demise of the monarchy and the bodily absence of a King caused a representational crisis in the early republic, forcing the American people to reconstruct the social symbolic order in a new and unfamiliar way. Social historians have routinely understood the Revolution and the early republic as projects dedicated to and productive of reason, with \"the people\" as an orderly and sensible collective at odds with the volatile and unthinking crowd. American Enchantment rejects this traditionally held vision of a rational public sphere, arguing that early Americans dealt with the post-monarchical crisis by engaging in \"civil mysticism,\" not systematic discussion and debate. By evaluating a wide range of social and political rituals and literary and cultural discourses, Sizemore shows how \"enchantment\" becomes a vital mode of enacting the people after the demise of traditional monarchical forms. In works by Charles Brockden Brown, Washington Irving, Catharine Sedgwick, and Nathaniel Hawthorne--as well as in Delaware oral histories, accounts of George Washington's inauguration, and Methodist conversion narratives--enchantment is an experience uniquely capable of producing new forms of popular power and social affiliation. Recognizing the role of enchantment in constituting the people overturns some of the most common-sense assumptions in the post-revolutionary world: above all, that the people are not simply a flesh-and-blood substance, but also a mystical force.",

Yet relatively little has been written about teaching a course whose very title suggests its prodigious chronological, geographic, and disciplinary scope. In the nineteenth century, History of the English Language courses focused on canonical British literary works. Since these early curricula were formed, the English language has changed, and so have the courses. In the twenty-first century, instructors account for the growing prominence of World Englishes as well as the English language's transformative relationship with the internet and social media.\rApproaches to Teaching the History of the English Language\u00a0addresses the challenges and circumstances that the course's instructors and students commonly face. The volume reads as a series of \"master classes\" taught by experienced instructors who explain the pedagogical problems that inspired resourceful teaching practices. Although its chapters are authored by seasoned teachers, many of whom are preeminent scholars in their individual fields, the book is designed for instructors at any career stage-beginners and veterans alike.\rThe topics addressed in\u00a0Approaches to Teaching the History of the English Language\u00a0include: the unique pedagogical dynamic that transpires in language study; the course's origins and relevance to current university curricula; scholarly approaches that can offer an abiding focus in a semester-long course; advice about navigating the course's formidable chronological ambit; ways to account for the language's many varieties; and the course's substantial and pedagogical relationship to contemporary multimedia platforms. Each chapter balances theory and practice, explaining in detail activities, assignments, or discussion questions ready for immediate use by instructors.",

The volume is global in focus, and chapters discuss data gathered in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, and South Korea. The common methods used by many of the contributors means that readers will be able to draw comparisons from the breadth of the volume.\u00a0The primary focus of this volume is geared toward an examination of dialect perceptions in and of cities, with an additional goal of presenting empirical, theoretical, and methodological advancements in Perceptual Dialectology. Authors\u2019 contributions to the collection examine how the urban setting influences perceptions of linguistic variation and, in the course of examining the connections between place and perceptions, explore several interrelated themes of linguistic variation, including the differences in the perception of rural and urban areas, processes of perception and language change, and the relationship between perception and \u2018reality\u2019.",

Through an examination of a variety of production and perception data, Louisvillians are shown to vary in their attitudes toward and production and perception of certain linguistic features in a way that indicates that they experience the border as the coming together of at least two distinct regions, one Southern and one non-Southern, seemingly choosing to align or disalign with different ones randomly. Non-Louisvillians, on the other hand, view the urban center as the other in the largely rural state. Using the example of Louisville, identities at the border are shown to be fluid, complex, and dynamic, where speakers constantly negotiate, contest, and shift between identities, in the active and agentive expression of their amplified awareness of belonging brought about by their position on the border.",

Through the interviews, the Samaritans themselves reveal how the digitizing of Samaritan manuscripts can advance global knowledge about their existence and culture. Unsurprisingly, Jim Ridolfo and his research are far ahead of the rest of us in bringing together digital humanities, rhetorical studies, writing studies and the crafting of a research methodology that honors the past while looking to the future.

In Digital Samaritans, Jim Ridolfo takes us on a fascinating journey during which a biblical parable becomes a symbol of a living, breathing people interested in extending themselves via the \u2018textual diaspora\u2019 created by a digital humanities project. Just as the culture of the Samaritans provides a bridge linking multiple peoples, Ridolfo argues, this case study provides incredible insight into the digital humanities and rhetorical studies, while also carrying wider implications for academic partnerships in the globally connected twenty-first century.\u201d        &mdash;Virginia Kuhn, University of Southern California  ", "            An engrossing case study of the confluences of sacred rhetorics, digital humanities, cultural identities, global politics, and miraculous serendipity, Jim Ridolfo\u2019s pilgrimage Digital Samaritans illustrates the sheer enormity of the work we\u2019re called to do.

While documenting his own experiences digitizing holy scriptures that have been dispersed geographically around the world in an attempt to serve the needs of a vanishing population in the Middle East, he forges connections between currently disconnected domains of rhetorical studies, the digital humanities, and engaged scholarship. Ridolfo uses this fascinating case study to explore the complex custody issues that emerge when diasporic communities archive traditional knowledge in computational media and work across distributed online networks.

      "summary": "\r\tViolence against women remains one of the most pervasive human rights violations in the world today, and it permeates every society, at every level. Such violence is considered a systemic, widespread and pervasive human rights violation, experienced largely by women because they are women. Yet at the international level, there is a gap in the legal protection of women from violence. There is currently no binding international convention that explicitly prohibits such violence; or calls for its elimination; or, mandates the criminalisation of all forms of violence against women.\r\tThis book critically analyses the treatment of violence against women in the United Nations system, and in three regional human rights systems. Each chapter explores the advantages and disadvantages coming from the legal instruments, the work of the monitoring systems, and the resulting findings and jurisprudence. The book proposes that the gap needs to be addressed through a new United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Violence against Women, or alternatively an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. A new Convention or Optional Protocol would be part of the transformative agenda that is needed to normatively address the promotion of a life free of violence for women, the responsibility of states to act with due diligence in the elimination of all forms of violence against all women, and the systemic challenges that are the causes and consequences of such violence.\r\r\u00a0\r",

Within each subculture, unique patterns of language use challenge normative assumptions about gender and sexual identity. Rusty Barrett's analyses of these subcultures emphasize the ways in which gay male constructions of gender are intimately linked to other forms of social difference.\u00a0\rIn\u00a0From Drag Queens to Leathermen, Barrett presents an extension of his earlier work among African American drag queens in the 1990s, emphasizing the intersections of race and class in the construction of gender. An analysis of sacred music among radical faeries considers the ways in which expressions of gender are embedded in a broader neo-pagan religious identity. The formation of bear as an identity category (for heavyset and hairy men) in the late 1980s involves the appropriation of linguistic stereotypes of rural Southern masculinity. Among regular attendees of circuit parties, language serves to differentiate gay and straight forms of masculinity. In the early 2000s, barebackers (gay men who eschew condoms) used language to position themselves as rational risk takers with an innate desire for semen. For participants in the International Mr. Leather contest, a disciplined, militaristic masculinity links expressions of patriotism with BDSM sexual practice.\rIn all of these groups, the construction of gendered identity involves combining linguistic forms that would usually not co-occur. These unexpected combinations serve as the foundation for the emergence of unique subcultural expressions of gay male identity, explicated at length in this book.",

      "summary": "In a democracy power is obtained via competition. Yet, as women gain access to parliaments in record numbers worldwide collaboration appears to be on the rise. This is puzzling: Why, if politicians can secure power via competition, would we ever observe collaboration? Using evidence from 200 interviews with political elites from 19 Argentine provinces, a novel dataset from 23 Argentine chambers over 18 years, and qualitative case studies from across the world, I reexamine traditional notions of competitive democracy by evaluating patterns of collaboration among legislators. In doing so, I tackle three important questions.\r\u00a0\rMy first question is: Can democracy be collaborative? I argue that collaborative democracy is not antithetical to competitive democracy. While only the bare majority can secure the power to decide via competition, I explain that all legislators\u2014particularly those who do not have power\u2014can influence the policy-making process through collaboration. Using bill cosponsorship data, which represents the culmination of the collaborative process, I demonstrate that democracy can be collaborative, that out-of-power legislators collaborate more frequently than those in power, and that women collaborate more than men.\r\rThis raises a second question: Why are female legislators more inclined to collaborate than their male colleagues? I explain that women collaborate more than men because they face structural barriers that restrict their ability to exert influence on the policy-making process. By collaborating with other women they can overcome structural barriers and attain political power. I show empirically that despite having high levels of descriptive representation as a group and seniority as individuals, women\u2019s marginalization exists across a vast array of legislative power including legislative leadership posts, committee leadership posts, and powerful committee appointments. This marginalization limits women\u2019s political power and motivates collaboration among women.\r\rFinally, this leads to my third question; if women are more collaborative, why do some female legislators collaborate successfully among themselves, while other women fail to do so? Specifically, I tackle the question: When do women collaborate? I argue that despite the benefits of collaboration, patterns of collaboration vary among female legislators because not all women have the same opportunities to work cooperatively. Different legislative contexts either facilitate or constrain women\u2019s collaboration. I show empirically that six key contextual variables that vary both across and within legislative chambers shape policy collaboration. First, I examine women\u2019s numeric representation and partisan pressures; both factors vary largely across legislative chambers. Then I focus on affiliation with the executive party, seniority, legislation targeting women\u2019s issues, and membership in a women\u2019s caucus or committee; each of these factors vary within legislative chambers. Taken together, the answers to these three important questions, contribute to our understanding of democracy by explaining why and when we can expect to observe collaboration in a democracy where power is obtained via competition.\r\rThis book uses a rich combination of both qualitative and quantitative data to support my central argument. The primary case analyzed is Argentina, where I compare women\u2019s legislative behavior at the provincial level in order to capture variation in institutional contexts within a single case. As the first country to adopt legislative gender quotas, Argentina is one of the only contexts in the world where women have held a sizable share of seats in the legislature over a long timeline in a large number of chambers. Gender quotas were first adopted in Argentina at the national level in 1991. The following year, quota adoption began to spread rapidly across the provincial legislatures. The figure below charts the adoption of gender quotas across the Argentine provinces.\r\rI draw on qualitative evidence from over 200 interviews with male and female legislators and elite political observers from 19 Argentine provinces. The fieldwork was conducted between 2007 and 2013 during six different trips to Argentina. My quantitative evidence comes from a novel dataset that I developed using archival data from 23 Argentine chambers over an 18-year period. The data includes all cosponsored legislation, committee appointments, and leadership posts for over 7,000 male and female legislators.\r\rI augment my careful analysis of Argentina with a series of qualitative case studies that examine women\u2019s legislative collaboration. This approach, which draws on examples from across the world, allows me to demonstrate the generalizability of the relationships observed in Argentina. Here I can account for more informal types of collaboration that occur in the policy-making process and extend my analysis to other legislative contexts. The depth provided by the Argentine analyses\u2014coupled with the breadth offered by these additional case studies\u2014makes this book the most comprehensive study of collaboration to date.",

      "summary": "Global tourism is perhaps the largest scale movement of goods, services, and people in history. Consequently, it is a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change. While tourism increasingly accounts for ever greater segments of national economies, the consequences of this growth for intercultural interaction are diverse and uncertain. The proliferation of tourists also challenges classic theoretical descriptions of just what an economy is. What are the commodities being consumed? What is the division of labor between producers and clients in creating the value of tourist exchanges? How do culture, power, and history shape these interactions? What are the prospects for sustainable tourism? How is cultural heritage being shaped by tourists around the world? \rThese critical questions inspired this volume in which the contributors explore the connections among economy, sustainability, heritage, and identity that tourism and related processes makes explicit. The volume moves beyond the limits of place-specific discussions, case studies, and best practice examples. Accordingly, it is organized according to three overarching themes: exploring dimensions of cultural heritage, the multi-faceted impacts of tourism on both hosts and guests, and the nature of touristic encounters. Based on ethnographic and archaeological research conducted in distinct locations, the contributors\u2019 conclusions and theoretical arguments reach far beyond the limits of isolated case studies. Together, they contribute to a new synthesis for the anthropology of tourism while simultaneously demonstrating how emerging theories of the economics of tourism can lead to the rethinking of traditionally non-touristic enterprises\u2014from farming to medical occupations.\r",

Questions are carefully posed to engage the reader in the contemporary problems arising in tourism. Who benefits? What does the tourist gain from the experience? Does the practice of staged authenticity destroy the meaning and significance of the original practice or re-enforce understanding for a new generation? What is ecotourism?

The Tonga, a matrilineal Bantu-speaking society, had long lived and farmed along the banks of the Zambezi River, but when the Kariba Dam was completed and the river valley was flooded in 1958, approximately 57,000 people were forcibly relocated. All of southern Africa has suffered from severe droughts in the last three decades, and the Gwembe Valley has proved particularly susceptible to failed harvests and sociopolitically and ecologically triggered crises.\rThe work of survival for the Gwembe Tonga includes difficult decisions about how to distribute inadequate resources among family members. Physically limited elderly Tonga who rely on their kin for food and assistance are particularly vulnerable. Cliggett examines Tonga household economies and support systems for the elderly. Old men and women, she finds, use deeply gendered approaches to encourage aid from their children and fend off starvation.\rIn extreme circumstances, often the only resources at people's disposal are social support networks. Cliggett's book tells a story about how people living in environmentally and economically dire circumstances manage their social and material worlds to the best of their ability, sometimes at the cost of maintaining kinship bonds\u2014a finding that challenges Western notions of family among indigenous people, especially in rural Africa.\r",

Nevertheless, many couples still experience significant stress because of their same-sex status. In every life context \u2014 family, work, neighborhood, religious communities, and in social and legal contexts \u2014 same-sex couples have to make decisions about disclosure, how to respond to prejudice, and how to cope with negative feelings about themselves and their experiences.\rThis book helps couples work together to identify, develop, and use their strengths and skills to successfully navigate these issues and flourish. Tough tasks like confronting prejudice will never be easy, but thanks to the stories, tools, and resources presented in this book, readers will learn to manage such situations in a positive way.\rLearning activities in each chapter guide couples to become more aware of the causes of stress in their relationship, and to take positive actions to strengthen their commitment. Readers will learn how to cultivate the strengths of their LGBTQ identities, assert appropriate boundaries, create supportive relationships with others, and contribute authentically to their families and communities.\r",

The Pleistocene glaciers had receded by this time, making food more plentiful in some areas and living conditions less hazardous. Although these Archaic peoples have long been known from their primary activities as hunters and gatherers of wild food resouces, recent evidence has been found that indicates they also began rudimentary cultivation sometime during the Middle Holocene.\u00a0\rRichard Jefferies--an Archaic specialist--comprehensively addresses the approximately 7,000 years of the prehistory of eastern North America, termed the Archaic Period by archaeologists. Jefferies centers his research on a 380-mile section of the Lower Ohio River Valley, an area rife with both temporary and long-term Archaic sites. He covers the duration of the Holocene and provides a compendium of knowledge of the era, including innovative research strategies and results. Presenting these data from a cultural-ecological perspective, emphasizing the relationships between hunter-gatherers and the environments in which they lived, Jefferies integrates current research strategies with emerging theories that are beginning to look at culture history in creative ways.\u00a0\r",

Castillo argues that these plays portray Amerindians not in their \u201cotherness\u201d but as subjects of empire. It is the author\u2019s contention that these dramas reveal the vast contradictions between the two leading ideological trends of the age as\u00a0performed on the stage: the discourse of honor and the juridical-theological code, both of which attempt to assimilate the Amerindian phenomenon under the auspices of church and state. These works consistently raise the paradoxical question of how a person can be a savage and have honor at the same time. The Amerindian must become a new \u201csubject\u201d for the Spanish Crown (as stated by the discourse of honor in these plays), i.e., an honorable and distinguished Indian capable of lofty speech and courage in battle. Yet, Amerindians are also barbarians or wild \u201cchildren\u201d (F. de Vitoria, Las Casas) who need the redemptive intervention of the Church to mature (evolve) and to be capable of salvation. These plays reveal the effort to integrate and assimilate the new indigenous entities under the monarcho-seigneurial system while exposing the philosophical contradictions that Baroque ideology has to overcome in order to elicit obedience.\u00a0",

Following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Ba\u2019thist Iraqi government by the United States and its allies in 2003, Kurdistan became a recognized part of the federal Iraqi system. The Region is now integrated through technology, media, and migration to the rest of the world.\rFocusing on household life in Kurdistan\u2019s towns and villages, King explores the ways that residents connect socially, particularly through patron-client relationships and as people belonging to gendered categories. She emphasizes that patrilineages (male ancestral lines) seem well adapted to the Middle Eastern modern stage and viceversa. The idea of patrilineal descent influences the meaning of refuge-seeking and migration as well as how identity and place are understood, how women and men interact, and how \u201cpoliticking\u201d is conducted.\rIn the new Kurdistan, old values may be maintained, reformulated, or questioned. King offers a sensitive interpretation of the challenges resulting from the intersection of tradition with modernity. Honor killings still occur when males believe their female relatives have dishonored their families, and female genital cutting endures. Yet, this is a region where modern technology has spread and seemingly everyone has a mobile phone. Households may have a startling combination of illiterate older women and educated young women. New ideas about citizenship coexist with older forms of patronage.\rKing is one of the very few scholars who conducted research in Iraq under extremely difficult conditions during the Saddam Hussein regime. How she was able to work in the midst of danger and in the wake of genocide is woven throughout the stories she tells.\u00a0Kurdistan on the Global Stage\u00a0serves as a lesson in field research as well as a valuable ethnography.\r",

Some Cambodians have chosen to learn French, making language policy decisions supportive of French language learning, in anticipation of education offered in French at universities locally and abroad. More Cambodians are studying and learning Chinese to procure jobs with firms owned or managed by Chinese speakers. A great many have chosen to learn English and to support English language learning in education. These decisions respond to the multiple demands and opportunities for employment with economic and assistance enterprises associated with virtually every nation or group of nations, for regional and international political communication, and for education in the global infrastructure of English-language universities.\rHaving thus contextualized and described Cambodians\u2019 contemporary language choices, the case study is applied to a theoretical debate in the field of language policy studies. The specifics of the Cambodian case fully confirm neither the \"language choice\" nor the \"linguistic imperialism\" explanation for the global spread of English. Rather, in Cambodia English is spreading as a result of both choice and promotion, it integrates with (though is not integral to) the contemporary global restructuring of the world, and has introduced results that, though aggregating toward amelioration, run the gamut from beneficial to exploitative for groups of Cambodians located variously along geographical, socioeconomic, ethnic, and other spectra.\r",

Between the sheets of popular magazines, editors offered belles-lettres to the masses and, in particular, middle-class women. Magazines became a place to find culture, humor, and intellectual affirmation alongside haute couture.\r\t\r\tEldred mines a variety of literary archives, notably the correspondence of Katharine Sargeant White of the New Yorker, to provide an insider's view of the publisher-editor-author dynamic. She chronicles the work at the major women's magazines of the day: Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, Vogue, and others enacted an editorial style similar to that of the New Yorker by offering literature, values, and culture to an educated and aspiring middle class. These publications created and sustained a mass literacy never before seen in American publishing.\r\u00a0\r",

While the book&#039;s focus is on the &#039;making of a &#039;New Yorker&#039; ethos,&#039; among Eldred&#039;s key points is that this ethos was not created in a vacuum.&quot;        &mdash;Feminist Collections  ", "            &quot;Long excerpts from White\u2019s correspondence with authors and with other New Yorker staff comprise so much of Literate Zeal that one may enjoy the book as an intimate and revealing epistolary biography of an important figure in twentieth-century American print culture.

Belonging can mean fitting in, feeling at home, feeling a part; this kind of belonging is profoundly social. Belongings can be possessions, objects closely associated with one\u2019s deepest notions of identity. Both kinds of belongings pertain to people and the kindreds, ethnic groups, and nations (and\/or states) they call their own. Belongings of both kinds are, more often than not, emplaced and territorialized.\rAll of the chapters treat Middle Eastern collectivities as sites of anguished cultural projects. All use metaphor: national territory as woman, national resolve as cactus, and so on. None is reductionistic; belonging is rendered in its complexity, with its agonies as well as its joys. All could be identified with a growing genre of work on belonging. At the heart of each are the bonds that comprise belonging. Each one conveys both belonging\u2019s messiness and its joys, and touches as much as it argues and elaborates.\r",

Using engaging and accessible commentary on antigay crusaders (Sally Kern and Anita Bryant) and two queer teachers dismissed from their positions (Billy James Hargis and Bruce Goff), Mason illustrates how the lives of these figures represent paradigmatic moments in conservative confrontations with queers and help us to understand the conflation of terrorism with homosexuality, which dates back to the McCarthy era.",

The first appearance of pottery in any area of the world is heralded as a new stage in the progress of humans toward a more complex arrangement of thought and society. Cultures are defined and separated by the occurrence of pottery types, and the association of pottery with mobility and agriculture continues to drive research in anthropology. For these reasons, the discovery of the earliest fiber-tempered pottery in the New World and carbonized remains identified as maize kernels is exciting.\rSan Jacinto 1 is the archaeological site located in the savanna region of the north coast of Colombia, South America, where excavations by led by the authors have revealed evidence of mobile hunter-gatherers who made pottery and who collected and processed plants from 6000 to 5000 B.P. The site is believed to show an early human adaptation to the tropics in the context of significant environmental changes that were taking place at the time.\rThis volume presents the data gathered and the interpretations made during excavation and analysis of the San Jacinto 1 site. By examining the social activities of a human population in a highly seasonal environment, it adds greatly to our contemporary understanding of the historical ecology of the tropics. Study of the artifacts excavated at the site allows a window into the early processes of food production in the New World. Finally, the data reveals that the origins of ceramic technology in the tropics were tied to a reduction in mobility and an increase in territoriality and are widely applicable to similar studies of sedentism and agriculture worldwide.\r",

Extending the author\u2019s earlier account of social life, and drawing on general ideas about events, processes, and change, the book conceptualizes social changes as configurations of significant differences in bundles of practices and material arrangements. Illustrated with examples from the history of bourbon distillation and the formation and evolution of digitally-mediated associations in contemporary life, the book argues that chains of activity combine with material events and processes to cause social changes.\u00a0 The book thereby stresses the significance of the material dimension of society for the constitution, determination, and explanation of social phenomena, as well as the types of space needed to understand them. The book also challenges the explanatory significance of such key phenomena as power, dependence, relations, mechanisms, and individual behavior. As such, it will appeal to sociologists, geographers, org studies scholars, and others interested in social life and social change.\r\r",

      "summary": "For nearly three decades, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC), waged a violent revolutionary struggle against the apartheid state in South Africa. Stephen Davis works with extensive oral testimonies and the heroic myths that were constructed after 1994 to offer a new history of this armed movement. Davis deftly addresses the histories that reinforce the legitimacy of the ANC as a ruling party, its longstanding entanglement with the South African Communist Party, and efforts to consolidate a single narrative of struggle and renewal in concrete museums and memorials. Davis shows that the history of MK is more complicated and ambiguous than previous laudatory accounts would have us believe, and in doing so he discloses the contradictions of the liberation struggle as well as its political manifestations.",

      "summary": "Ancient cities were complex, political, and economic entities, but they also suffered from inequality, poor sanitation, and disease--often more than rural areas. Offering a balanced understanding of urbanism and a synthesis of previous research, Scott Hutson examines ancient Maya cities, including Chunchucmil, Tikal, and Dzibilchaltun, to determine why people chose to live in these urban environments. He argues that despite the hazards of urban life, Maya cities continued to lure residents for many centuries. With built forms that welcomed crowds, neighborhoods that offered domestic comforts, marketplaces that facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas, and opportunities to expand social networks and capital, Maya cities were used in familiar ways.\u00a0\r",

      "summary": "Intended for students of intermediate organic chemistry, this text shows how to write a reasonable mechanism for an organic chemical transformation. The discussion is organized by types of mechanisms and the conditions under which the reaction is executed, rather than by the overall reaction as is the case in most textbooks. The treatment emphasizes unifying principles, showing how common mechanisms link seemingly disparate reactions. Each chapter discusses common mechanistic pathways and suggests practical tips for drawing them. Worked problems are included in the discussion of each mechanism, and \u201ccommon error alerts\u201d are scattered throughout the text to warn readers about pitfalls and misconceptions that bedevil students. Each chapter is capped by a large problem set. The author has drawn on his own research and the current literature to ensure that appropriate attention is given to topics across the range of modern organic chemistry. The text is unique in its inclusion of a chapter on reactions mediated or catalyzed by transition metals, an area in which mechanistic understanding is now essential. Relatively new topics such as olefin metathesis and cycloaromatization are covered without giving short shrift to more traditional areas such as carbonyl chemistry. The text assumes a basic knowledge of organic chemistry. It can be used either in a formal course or by students working on their own, and will be particularly useful for graduate students studying for qualifying examinations. It will also be useful to students and researchers in biochemistry, pharmacology, and inorganic chemistry.",

I just wanted to let you know how much your book got me through the past year of course work. We, like everyone else, use Carey and Sundberg for our advanced organic classes. I personally do not care much for those books and therefore seek better explanation\/understanding through other texts such as Lowry an Richardson and Carrol. When it came to mechanisms, I found the clarity and thoroughness I needed only in your book. It was impressive how you were able to present so much information in a clear and comprehensive manner yet keep the book so managable [sic] in size.\r\rIn addition to the text, I also was able to benefit from the problems. I was sure I had the answer for more than a couple but I was way off on some of them! Great practice!! The on-line answers are much better than looking up answers by reference as in Carey and Sundberg. The JOC and JACS journals in our library from 1960s-1980s are a wreck because every year 20 or so first year grad students go tearing off through the journals looking up answers.\r\rJust wanted to say thanks for such a helpful book.

I am writing in admiration (and gratitude) for your book, &quot;The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms&quot; (2nd Ed.). You see, I have just finished taking my Organic comprehensive exam last Tuesday and (even though I still had a difficult time with the exam) I am ecstatic that I passed. As I have always considered organic mechanisms my Waterloo in Org-Chem, I have found your book and methods of great help. The explanations were very clear and all ideas were excellently presented. The excercises [sic] with the online answers were helpful in preparing too. I&#039;d gladly recommend the book to anyone preparing for similar exams or even those who just want to brush up on mechanisms.\r\rAgain, thanks for the great book. A lot of chemistry students (undergraduate and graduate) at our University are already finding your book really helpful.        &mdash;David Peralta, personal communication  ", "            I bought this book to practice mechanisms because I&#039;ll be taking a physical organic class in the spring that uses them heavily. I used this book instead of sitting in on a sophomore organic class, because by job as a TA conflicted.\r\rAnyway, this book is extraordinary. Dr. Grossman has taught me so many things about how to write a correct mechanism and how to recognize a bad mechanism when I see one. The book is written in a very clear and friendly manner and it&#039;s really quite hard to put down when you start reading it.\r\rThe book also has practice problems and the book&#039;s website has the answers, giving even more incentive to practice mechanisms.        &mdash;Jason B., Amazon.com  ", "            Wow. I have been searching for a book like this since my undergrad days at the University of Pittsburgh. Not much more to say about this book than has already been said. I will however say that this is the most concise book that I have ever found on the theory of mechanisms. It is decievingly short, for it encompases all the major topics you will find in your 1200 page O-chem text, and dare I say, may be just as, if not more usefull.\r\rIn organic chemistry it is not important to memorize a vast amount of material as, incorrectly, most neophyte students believe. The science really is an art with a few major rules that outline the whole of the science. If you truly UNDERSTAND these rules, and use this book for that purpose, you will succeed at any Organic course any school has to offer. Buy this book. Practice your problems.

      "summary": "From the beginning, rhetoric has been a productive and practical art aimed at preparing citizens to participate in communal life. Possibilities for this participation are continually evolving in light of cultural and technological changes.\u00a0The Available Means of Persuasion: Mapping a Theory and Pedagogy of Multimodal Public Rhetoric\u00a0explores the ways that public rhetoric has changed due to emerging technologies that enable us to produce, reproduce, and distribute compositions that integrate visual, aural, and alphabetic elements. David M. Sheridan, Jim Ridolfo, and Anthony J. Michel argue that to exploit such options fully, rhetorical theory and pedagogy need to be reconfigured. Rhetorical concepts such as invention, context, and ethics need to be transformed, which has important implications for the writing classroom, among other sites of rhetorical education.\rSheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel suggest an expanded understanding of the ancient rhetorical concept of\u00a0kairos\u00a0(the opportune moment) as a unifying heuristic that can help theorists, teachers, and practitioners understand, teach, and produce multimodal public rhetoric more effectively. In this expanded sense,\u00a0kairos\u00a0includes considerations of genre and dissemination through material-cultural contexts. Ultimately, they argue that culture itself is at stake in our understanding of multimodal public rhetoric. Important cultural categories such as race, class, gender, sexuality, and place, are produced and reproduced not just through the dynamics of language but through the full range of multimodal practices.\r",

I focus on how code, space and place interact as people increasingly use mobile, digital technologies to navigate through their everyday, lived geographies.  Of special interest is the complex and often duplicitous manner that code and content can congeal and individualize our experiences in the hybrid, digitally augmented places that cities are becoming. \rAs an economic geographer I also study how flows of material goods in the global economy are shaped by immaterial flows of information.  Just as the global financial system is enabled by the materiality of high-speed fiber optic cables laid across the ocean, so too are the movement of cargo containers dependent upon the halo of virtual information that surrounds them as they move through space. My interest is in the range of ways in which material and virtual flows are intertwined: sometimes complementary, sometimes contradictory, but always central to the evolution of spatial relations in the economy.\rThe FloatingSheep research blog provide an overview of this work, particularly some of the more quirky dimensions that are hard to place in more mainstream academic outlets.  After all, the Internet (and information space more generally) can be a wild and woolly place.\rI am also the Director of the The DOLLY Project (Data On Local Life and You) is a repository of billions of geolocated tweets that allows for real-time research and analysis.  Building on top of existing open source technology, DOLLY ingests all geotagged tweets (~8 million a day), does basic analysis, indexing and geocoding to allows real-time search throughout the entire database (3 billion tweets since Dec 2011). DOLLY also forms the basis for establishing the Department of Geography at the University of Kentucky as a key center for critical research on big geosocial media data.  We see DOLLY as both a key tool for our own work but also as a means to break down the technological barrier that is often present for researchers that would like to study big data but do not necessarily possess the required technical skills.\rMost recently I joined the editorial team of the new journal, Big Data & Society: Critical Interdisciplinary Inquiries, an open access peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes interdisciplinary work principally in the social sciences, humanities and computing and their intersections with the arts and natural sciences about the implications of Big Data for societies.

First, by analyzing securely reconstructable consonant clusters at word's edge, he devises a methodology which allows us to predict which types of consonant clusters could occur word-medially in PIE. Thus, a number of previously disconnected phonological rules can now be understood as being part of a conspiracy motivated by violations in syllable structure. Second, he uncovers evidence of morphological influence within the syllable, created by processes such as quantitative ablaut. These advances allow us to view PIE as a synchronic grammar, one which can be described by -- and contribute to -- modern linguistic theory.",

      "summary": "\r\tFifteen years after the end of a protracted civil and regional war, Beirut broke out in violence once again, forcing residents to contend with many forms of insecurity, amid an often violent political and economic landscape. Providing a picture of what ordinary life is like for urban dwellers surviving sectarian violence,\u00a0The Insecure City\u00a0captures the day-to-day experiences of citizens of Beirut moving through a war-torn landscape.\r\r\t\u00a0\r\r\tWhile living in Beirut, Kristin Monroe conducted interviews with a diverse group of residents of the city. She found that when people spoke about getting around in Beirut, they were also expressing larger concerns about social, political, and economic life. It was not only violence that threatened Beirut\u2019s ordinary residents, but also class dynamics that made life even more precarious. For instance, the installation of checkpoints and the rerouting of traffic\u2014set up for the security of the elite\u2014forced the less fortunate to alter their lives in ways that made them more at risk. Similarly, the ability to pass through security blockades often had to do with an individual\u2019s visible markers of class, such as clothing, hairstyle, and type of car. Monroe examines how understandings and practices of spatial mobility in the city reflect social differences, and how such experiences led residents to be bitterly critical of their government.\r\r\t\u00a0\r\r\tIn\u00a0The Insecure City, Monroe takes urban anthropology in a new and meaningful direction, discussing traffic in the Middle East to show that when people move through Beirut they are experiencing the intersection of citizen and state, of the more and less privileged, and, in general, the city\u2019s politically polarized geography.\r",

      "summary": "This study is a quantitative investigation of a large corpus of 16th-century Slovak administrative-legal texts that analyzes the degree of morphological normalization in early vernacular writing in the Slovak lands (prior to the codification of standard Slovak in the 18th and 19th centuries). Nine key morphological features are examined, and the patterns of normalization observed are assessed to determine their geographical scope and possible linguistic basis. Accompanying the morphological investigation is a theoretical and methodological discussion and application of Diglossia as a sociolinguistic framework for interpretation of the interaction of written Czech and Slovak in precodification Slovakia. This book thus provides both new empirical data on the language of 16th-century Slovak texts, as well as a conceptual model for sociolinguistic interpretation of the early developmental stages of vernacular writing in Slovakia.",

      "summary": "For years, conventional scholarship has argued that minority groups are better served when the majority groups that absorb them are willing to recognize and allow for the preservation of indigenous identities. But is the reinforcement of ethnic identity among migrant groups always a process of self-liberation? In this surprising study, Carmen Mart\u00ednez Novo draws on her ethnographic research of the Mixtec Indians\u2019 migration from the southwest of Mexico to Baja California to show that sometimes the push for indigenous labels is more a process of external oppression than it is of minority empowerment.\rIn Baja California, many Mixtec Indians have not made efforts to align themselves as a coherent demographic. Instead, Mart\u00ednez Novo finds that the push for indigenous identity in this region has come from local government agencies, economic elites, intellectuals, and other external agents. Their concern has not only been over the loss of rich culture. Rather, the pressure to maintain an indigenous identity has stemmed from the desire to secure a reproducible abundance of cheap \u201cIndian\u201d labor. Meanwhile, many Mixtecs reject their ethnic label precisely because being \u201cIndian\u201d means being a commercial agriculture low-wage worker or an urban informal street vendor\u2014an identity that interferes with their goals of social mobility and economic integration.\rBringing a critical new perspective to the complex intersection among government and scholarly agendas, economic development, global identity politics, and the aspirations of local migrants, this provocative book is essential reading for scholars working in the fields of sociology, anthropology, and ethnic studies.\r",

Martinez Novo not only poses this rather interesting problem, but investigates it with an innovative methodology and supports it with sound scholarship.        &mdash;Steve Striffler, author of &amp;quot;In the Shadows of State and Capital&amp;quot;  " ],
